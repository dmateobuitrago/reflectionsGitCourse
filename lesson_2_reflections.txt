// Second lesson reflections

=======What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?====================

When I initialize a repository a '.git' file is created
inside the repository. It is needed to start tracking
the repository files, in order to commit do other stuff
that git allows.

====== How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
===================

I think the stagging area is like a middle point where you
can choose whether to add or to remove files to your commit.

====== How can you use the staging area to make sure
you have one commit per logical change? ======

The stagging area could be used to compare the files 
that are going to be commited, so you can be sure that
the you are going to commit the changes you are intended
to change, no more, no less.

===== What are some situations when branches would be helpful
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?===

Some situations can be when you want to try something you are not 
sure that will work, some experiment. Or if you want to make an 
other language version using branches would be a good idea.
Branches are helpful because you can try some new things or do
some relevant changes without risking the master history.
