// Second lesson reflections

=======What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?====================

When I initialize a repository a '.git' file is created
inside the repository. It is needed to start tracking
the repository files, in order to commit do other stuff
that git allows.

====== How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
===================

I think the stagging area is like a middle point where you
can choose whether to add or to remove files to your commit.
