==========When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?===============

When I'm working on an other computer or when I'm working
in someone else project as a contributor.

=========Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository? =================================

You might want to always pull changes manually because thats
the only way you know what changes you are pulling. If you let 
Git to pull the changes automatically your project could be
changed without prior notice and it could affect the work you
are doing. So is better to understand what changes are you pulling
and pull them when you think is proper.
