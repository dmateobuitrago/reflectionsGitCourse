==========When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?===============

When I'm working on an other computer or when I'm working
in someone else project as a contributor.

=========Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository? =================================

You might want to always pull changes manually because thats
the only way you know what changes you are pulling. If you let 
Git to pull the changes automatically your project could be
changed without prior notice and it could affect the work you
are doing. So is better to understand what changes are you pulling
and pull them when you think is proper.

======Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?=====================

- Branches: I would use them when I need to start a new feature in 
my project, or try something that I'm not sure it will work, or
to work on a different version of my project, or to fix something.

- Clone: I would use Clone when I want to work on a project that is
shared online and I want to work on it in my computer, weather is
public or some friend handle it to me. Also I suppose that I can
clone repositories along my computer.

- Forks: I would use Fork when I want to work in a project that I
found online but I don't want to push my commits to that repository, 
I'd rather push them to my own online repository and let others to 
do the same. In this way I also can link the original creator to 
the project.
